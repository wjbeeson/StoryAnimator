				<Text>After a long day of work travel, I found myself unwinding in my Embassy Suites hotel room on the 5th floor. My evening was quite ordinary, involving some relaxation with a movie, a brief moment of self-pleasure, and enjoying a little bit of weed on my suite's balcony. By 11 pm, I was ready to sleep. </Text>

				<Text>About half an hour later, as I teetered on the edge of sleep, a startling series of loud thwacks against the balcony door jolted me awake. My heart raced and my eyes widened in shock, realizing that someone was on my balcony â€“ a baffling thought for a room so high up. I was almost in a trance, my mind blank, as I felt an inexplicable pull towards the door, like a moth drawn to light. With a mix of timidity and determination, I approached, my rational thinking suspended.  </Text>
